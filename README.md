# Strapi Deep API-Population Plugin

A lightweight, powerful Strapi 5 plugin that automatically handles deep population for Media fields, Relations, and Nested Components. No more manually adding `populate=*` or complex query strings to your API calls.

## 🎯 Plugin Goal

This plugin solves the "partial population" headache in Strapi by allowing you to define global or per-content-type rules for data fetching.

- **Deep Population**: Automatically populates nested components and dynamic zones.
- **Media & Relations**: Ensure images, videos, and relational data are always included in your API responses.
- **Admin Configuration**: Toggle population settings via a dedicated settings page in the Strapi Admin panel.
- **Zero Query Config**: Clean up your frontend code by removing massive `populate` objects from your fetch requests.

## 📦 Installation

### From NPM (Published Package)

```bash
npm install @webbycrown/strapi-api-deep-populate
```

### Enable in Strapi

Add the plugin to your `config/plugins.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  webbycommerce: {
    enabled: true,
    resolve: require.resolve("@webbycrown/strapi-api-deep-populate"),
  },
});
```

### Local Development

If you're developing locally, you can enable it from the local path:

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  webbycommerce: {
    enabled: true,
    resolve: "./src/plugins/strapi-api-deep-populate",
  },
});
```

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Plugin Settings

Navigate to **Settings → Strapi API-Deep Population** in the Strapi admin panel. You'll find several configuration tabs:

#### **Configure Tab**

- **Enable Auto-Populate**: A master toggle to turn the deep population logic on or off globally without needing to restart your server.

## 📚 API Documentation

This plugin does not create new endpoints; instead, it automatically enhances your existing Strapi Content-Type APIs (e.g., /api/articles, /api/pages).

By default, Strapi REST APIs return a "shallow" response. With this plugin enabled, your existing endpoints will now automatically include:

- **Media Fields**: Full URLs and metadata for images, videos, and files.
- **Relations**: Linked data from other Content-Types .
- **Nested Components**: All data within simple components and repeatable components.
- **Dynamic Zones**: Every component within a Dynamic Zone is fully expanded.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Showing

- Verify the location: Navigate to Settings and look under the Global Settings section in the left sidebar.
- Check config/plugins.js: Ensure the plugin is enabled or not.
- Rebuild Admin: Run npm run build followed by npm run develop to recompile the admin panel with the new settings UI.
